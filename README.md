# Calculator
This web interface is a basic calculator , with feature including basic computation needs for arithematics, some advanced functions and methods for higher order of calculations.

->The idea behind building the website application rather than an app, is that websites are more flexible, easy to be accessed, more robust and faster to use along with a execution and loading factor being greater than many apps :)

->Also it becomes quit easy in factor of time consumed to make any changes in future for this project.
